I have tested the performance of total download and upload times by varying the MAXSIZE parameter. The following are the experiment setups:

SETUP 1:

I uploaded a total of 98 files, the total size of which is 52 MB and an average size of 540 KB. The file size range is 130KB to 2.4 MB.

1. MAXSIZE = 0 KB : All files are on disk 
Uploading time (to filesystem) = 12.5 secs 
Downloading time = 0.99 secs

2. MAXSIZE = 3 MB : All files are in the database 
Uploading time (to database) = 36 secs 
Downloading time = 2.4 secs

3. MAXSIZE = 500 KB : 57 files are in the database and 41 files on disk 
Uploading time = 20 secs 
Downloading time = 1.8 secs 

SETUP 2:

I uploaded a total of 129 files, their total size being 4.2 MB. There are 52 - 1KB files and 77 images files having 50 KB average size and their sizes range from 10KB to 120 KB.

1. MAXSIZE = 0 KB : All files are on disk 
Uploading time (to filesystem) = 13.5 secs 
Downloading time = 0.69 secs

2. MAXSIZE = 2 KB : All 1 KB files in the database and bigger files on disk
Uploading time = 13.2 secs 
Downloading time = 0.68 secs

3. MAXSIZE = 50 KB : Some files on disk and some in the database
Uploading time = 14 secs 
Downloading time = 0.75 secs

4. MAXSIZE = 150 KB : All files in the database 
Uploading time = 14 secs 
Downloading time = 0.80 secs
